# VexTippingPtPrograms
The programs for 98271E 2021-2022 season.


## Current Programs: - [Here](https://brysonv10.github.io/VexTippingPoint/)



## How this repo is set up:
I have each program in a different branch to allow each to have its own git history. The branch name is the same name as the program name. 
I also have a website set up to track each item.
