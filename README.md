# VexTippingPtPrograms
The programs for 98271E 2021-2022 season.


## Current Programs:
1. FirstDriving - a basic driving program with NO arm and NO auton.
2. SimpleAuton - driving program plus auton that goes to yellow goal and pulls it in - 20 point auton
3. PnuematicTest - driving program plus pnuematic code, first time using pnuematics. *Generally archived, we have decided to use pnuematics in all the basic programs so this program really isn't applicable.*


## How this repo is set up:
I have each program in a different branch to allow each to have its own git history. The branch name is the same name as the program name.
