## Vex Team 98271E

This website is hosted on github pages cause I'm too lazy to make my own site.

### The Setup
In GitHub, I have each program with its own branch. This allows for tracking of the program over time with gradual evolution. It also allows for each program to have its own environment with the best setup.

I'm going to track the programs [here](https://brysonv10.github.io/VexTippingPoint/programtracker) as we continue on with the season. I have a graph that shows what is still being maintained and actively used. 


Program Tracking
================

## Each program has its own row in the table and is actively being tracked to check which is still being maintained. 
Key:
‚úÖ Used in Competition and Maintained
üîß Needs Maintenance due to robot update
‚ùå No longer used - Archived

| Program Name | Maintenance Status | Notes|
| -------------| -------------------| -----|
| FirstDriving | ‚úÖ | None |
| SimpleAuton  | ‚úÖ | None |
| PneumaticTest | ‚ùå | No longer used since this was more of a test program for learning to program pnuematics |
