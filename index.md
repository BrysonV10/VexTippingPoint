### The Setup
In GitHub, I have each program with its own branch. This allows for tracking of the program over time with gradual evolution. It also allows for each program to have its own environment with the best setup.

I'm going to track the programs here as we continue on with the season. I have a table that shows what is still being maintained and actively used. 


Program Tracking
================

## Each program has its own row in the table and is actively being tracked to check which is still being maintained. 
**Key:**  
‚úÖ Used in Competition and Maintained  
üîß Needs Maintenance due to robot update  
‚ùå No longer used - Archived
