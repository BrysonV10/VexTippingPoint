## Vex Team 98271E

This website is hosted on github pages cause I'm too lazy to make my own site.

### The Setup
In GitHub, I have each program with its own branch. This allows for tracking of the program over time with gradual evolution. It also allows for each program to have its own environment with the best setup.

I'm going to track the programs here as we continue on with the season. I have a graph that shows what is still being maintained and actively used.
